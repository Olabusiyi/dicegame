# dicegame

This was one fo my first major JavaScript project was designed to use a random number generator to program a simple dice game which can be launched  with a simple refresh!

The images folder contains all the dice faces
The index.html file is the web app homepage
The index.js file contains the javascript code 
The styles.css file contains the cascading stylesheet for the app
